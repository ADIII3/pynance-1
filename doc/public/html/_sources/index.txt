PyNance 
=======

:Release: |release|
:Date:  |today|

PyNance is open-source software with tools for retrieving, analysing and visualizing
data from stock and derivatives markets.

Installation
------------

For Python 2.7.x::

    pip install pynance

For Python 3.x.x::

    pip3 install pynance

Basics
---------------

Stock quotes maintained by `Yahoo! Finance <http://finance.yahoo.com/>`_ 
can be retrieved with the simple command::

    >>> import pynance as pn
    >>> ge = pn.data.get('ge', '1962', '2015')

Current options quotes can be retrieved using::

    >>> geopt, geexp = pn.opt.get('ge').info()

The options data retrieved can then be analysed using functions from :mod:`pynance.opt`.

Many of the functions in the submodules of :mod:`pynance.data` have been designed
for easy creation of features and labels for machine learning applications. You can
pass metrics from :mod:`pynance.tech` along with numeric parameters to create highly
customizable data sets to which machine learning algorithms can then be applied.
Examples can be found in the documentation for :mod:`pynance.data`.
